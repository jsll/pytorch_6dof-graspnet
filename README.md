# 6-DoF GraspNet: Variational Grasp Generation for Object Manipulation

This is a PyTorch implementation of [6-DoF
GraspNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10520). The original Tensorflow
implementation can be found here <https://github.com/NVlabs/6dof-graspnet>.

## Installation

This code has been tested with python 3.6, PyTorch 1.4 and CUDA 10.0 on Ubuntu
18.04. To install do

1) `pip3 install torch==1.4.0+cu100 torchvision==0.5.0+cu100 -f <https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html>`

2) Clone this repository: `git clone
   git@github.com:jsll/pytorch_6dof-graspnet.git`.

3) Clone pointnet++: `git@github.com:erikwijmans/Pointnet2_PyTorch.git`.

4) Run `cd Pointnet2_PyTorch && pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

5) `cd pytorch_6dof-graspnet`

6) Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install necessary python libraries.

7) (Optional) Download the trained models either by running `sh
   checkpoints/download_models.sh` or manually from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B0EeVlHbYBki__WszkbY8A3Za941K8QI/view?usp=sharing). Trained
   models are released under [CC-BY-NC-SA 2.0](TRAINED_MODEL_LICENSE).

## Disclaimer

The pre-trained models released in this repo are retrained from scratch and not converted from the original ones <https://github.com/NVlabs/6dof-graspnet> trained in Tensorflow. I tried to convert the Tensorflow models but with no luck. Although I trained the new models for a substantial amount of time on the same training data, no guarantees to their performance compared to the original work can be given.

## Updates

In the paper, the authors only used gradient-based refinement. Recently, they released a Metropolis-Hastings
sampling method which they found to give better results in shorter time. As a result, I keep the Metropolis-Hastings sampling as the default for the demo.

This repository also includes an improved grasp sampling network which was
proposed here <https://github.com/NVlabs/6dof-graspnet>. The new grasp sampling
network is trained with [Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03590.pdf).

### Update 9th June 2020

I have now uploaded new models that are trained for longer and until the test loss flattened. The new models can be downloaded in the same way as detailed in step 7 above.

## Demo

Run the demo using the command below

```shell
python -m demo.main
```

Per default, the demo script runs the GAN sampler with sampling based
refinement. To use the VAE sampler and/or gradient refinement run:

```shell
python -m demo.main --grasp_sampler_folder checkpoints/vae_pretrained/ --refinement_method gradient
```

## Dataset

### Get ShapeNet Models

Download the meshes with ids written in [shapenet_ids.txt](shapenet_ids.txt) from <https://www.shapenet.org/.> Some of the objects are in `ShapenetCore` and `ShapenetSem`.

### Prepare ShapeNet Models

1. Clone and build: <https://github.com/hjwdzh/Manifold>
2. Create a watertight mesh version assuming the object path is model.obj: `manifold model.obj temp.watertight.obj -s`
3. Simplify it: `simplify -i temp.watertight.obj -o model.obj -m -r 0.02`

### Download the dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GkFrkvpP-R1letnv6rt_WLSX80o43Jjm). The dataset has 3 folders:

1) `grasps` folder: contains all the grasps for each object.
2) `meshes` folder: has the folder for all the meshes used. Except `cylinder` and `box` the rest of the folders are empty and need to be populated by the downloaded meshes from shapenet.
3) `splits` folder: contains the train/test split for each of the categories.

Verify the dataset by running `python grasp_data_reader.py` to visualize the evaluator data and `python grasp_data_reader.py --vae-mode` to visualize only the positive grasps.

## Training

To train the grasp sampler (vae or gan) or the evaluator with bare minimum configurations run:

```shell
python3 train.py  --arch {vae,gan,evaluator}  --dataset_root_folder $DATASET_ROOT_FOLDER
```

where the `$DATASET_ROOT_FOLDER` is the path to the dataset you downloaded.

To monitor the training, run `tensorboard --logdir checkpoints/` and click <http://localhost:6006/>.

For more training options run
GAN Training Example Command:

```shell
python3 train.py  --help
```

## Quantitative Evaluation

I have not converted the code for doing quantitative evaluation
<https://github.com/NVlabs/6dof-graspnet/blob/master/eval.py> to PyTorch. I
would appreciate it if someone could convert it and send in a pull request.
